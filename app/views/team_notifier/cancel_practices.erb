Dear Captain,

We have determined that in September the last practice of the day will be at
6pm, and have therefore had to cancel all practices scheduled at 7pm.
Please login to your team management account and schedule a new
practice for the month of September. We’re very sorry for this
change, but hope you will understand that no practices can occur after
the sun goes down.

Warm regards,

Philadelphia International Dragon Boat Festival
