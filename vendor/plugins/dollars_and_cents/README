= dollars_and_cents plugin for Rails

A transparent handler for storing monetary values as integer fields in a
database.

== Installation

If your project is source-controlled by Subversion (which it should be, really),
the easiest way to install this is via Rails' plugin script:

  ./script/plugin install -x http://svn.codahale.com/dollars_and_cents/trunk

If you're not using Subversion, or if you don't want it adding
<tt>svn:externals</tt> in your project, remove the <tt>-x</tt> switch:

  ./script/plugin install http://svn.codahale.com/dollars_and_cents/trunk

== Usage

In this example, let's assume we have a price we need to store in our database.

1. Create a database field named +price_in_cents+, of type +INTEGER+.
2. Access the price as follows:
    @product.price          #=> 29.99
    @product.price = 24.99  #=> 24.99
    @product.price          #=> 24.99
